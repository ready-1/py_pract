# Py_Pract

This repo holds a few projects I have completed to learn Python.

## Environment
Python 3.8.1 (default, Dec 27 2019, 18:06:00)
[Clang 11.0.0 (clang-1100.0.33.16)] on darwin

I edit in Visual Studio Code.  It seems to be easier to get up and running than the other editors I have tried and, besides, I like it.

My preferred OS is Mac, although I have an affinity for anything POSIX.  I keep a Windows machine close at hand, but don't really do any dev work on it.

## The Projects
The first 36 are from [practicepython.org](http://www.practicepython.org/)
1. [Character Input](http://www.practicepython.org/exercise/2014/01/29/01-character-input.html)
2. [Odd or Even](http://www.practicepython.org/exercise/2014/02/05/02-odd-or-even.html)
