# Py_Pract

This repo holds a few projects I have completed to learn Python.

## Environment
- Python 3.8.1 (default, Dec 27 2019, 18:06:00[Clang 11.0.0 (clang-1100.0.33.16)] on darwin
- The projects are sandboxed in a 3.8.1 venv
- All project code is in a ./src subdirectory

- I edit in Visual Studio Code.  It seems to be easier to get up and running than the other editors I have tried and, besides, I like it.

- My preferred OS is Mac, although I have an affinity for anything POSIX.  I keep a Windows machine close at hand, but don't really do any dev work on it.
