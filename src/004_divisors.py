"""004_divisors.py

Python learning project from
http://www.practicepython.org/exercise/2014/02/26/04-divisors.html

Create a program that asks the user for a number and then prints out a list 
of all the divisors of that number. (If you donâ€™t know what a divisor is, it 
is a number that divides evenly into another number. For example, 13 is a 
divisor of 26 because 26 / 13 has no remainder.)
