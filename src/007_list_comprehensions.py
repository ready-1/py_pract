Python learning project from
https://www.practicepython.org/exercise/2014/03/19/07-list-comprehensions.html

Letâ€™s say I give you a list saved in a variable: 
a = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]. 
Write one line of Python that takes this list a and makes a new list that 
has only the even elements of this list in it.

"""

# make some vars
a = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]
b = []

# check eveness and put evens in b
b = [i for i in a if (i%2 == 0)]

# display the result
print(f'\nThe even numbers in {a} are {b}\n')
