This is a Python learning project from 
https://www.practicepython.org/exercise/2014/03/26/08-rock-paper-scissors.html

Make a two-player Rock-Paper-Scissors game. (Hint: Ask for player plays 
(using input), compare them, print out a message of congratulations to the 
winner, and ask if the players want to start a new game)

Remember the rules:

    Rock beats scissors
    Scissors beats paper
    Paper beats rock
