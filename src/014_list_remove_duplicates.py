"""014_list_remove_duplicates.py

This is a Python learning project from:
http://www.practicepython.org/exercise/2014/05/15/14-list-remove-duplicates.html

Write a program (function!) that takes a list and returns a new list that 
contains all the elements of the first list minus all the duplicates.

Extras:

    1. Write two different functions to do this - one using a loop and 
    constructing a list, and another using sets.

    2. Go back and do Exercise 5 using sets, and write the solution for 
    that in a different function.
