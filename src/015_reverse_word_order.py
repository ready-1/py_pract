"""015_reverse_word_order.py

This is a Python learning project from:
http://www.practicepython.org/exercise/2014/05/21/15-reverse-word-order.html

Write a program (using functions!) that asks the user for a long string 
containing multiple words. Print back to the user the same string, except 
with the words in backwards order. For example, say I type the string:

  My name is Michele

Then I would see the string:

  Michele is name My

shown back to me.

"""

print('Hello World! This is 015_reverse_word_order.py\n')
