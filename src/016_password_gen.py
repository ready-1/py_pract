"""016_password_gen.py

This is a Python learning project from:
http://www.practicepython.org/exercise/2014/05/28/16-password-generator.html

Write a password generator in Python. Be creative with how you generate 
passwords - strong passwords have a mix of lowercase letters, uppercase 
letters, numbers, and symbols. The passwords should be random, generating 
a new password every time the user asks for a new password. Include your 
run-time code in a main method.

Extra:

    Ask the user how strong they want their password to be. For weak 
    passwords, pick a word or two from a list.

"""

The thought process behind this program is to create an pool array of either
printable ASCII character or English word candidates based upon the user's 
strength request.

From this candidate pool, use a while loop to append items to a raw password 
list until the minimum length requirement is met.  By using a minimum length, 
we are able to more simply accomodate the word candidates rather than having 
to match an  exact length.

Once the length requirement is met, then join the raw password list into a
string.  If the strength requirement is Level 1 (words only), join the 
words with a hyphen for readability.

Lastly, display the password to the user.
